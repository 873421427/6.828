<h2>Lab: Simple xv6 shell</h2>

<p>
This lab will shed light on how UNIX shells use basic system calls.

<p>
Your job is to write a simple shell for xv6. It should be able to run
commands with arguments, handle input and output redirection, and set
up two-element pipelines. Your shell should act like
the xv6 shell <tt>sh</tt> for these examples as well as similar
commands:

<pre>
echo hello there
echo something > file.txt
ls | grep READ
grep lion < data.txt | wc > count
echo echo hello | nsh
find . b | xargs grep hello
</pre>

<p>
You should put your shell source in <tt>user/nsh.c</tt>, and modify
the <tt>Makefile</tt> to compile it.
We'll test your <tt>user/nsh.c</tt> with our copies of
other xv6 files; so while you can modify other files, your
shell should not depend on those modifications.
Your shell should use <tt>@</tt> (at sign) as a prompt rather
than <tt>$</tt>, to avoid confusion with the real shell.
An xv6 session with your shell might look like this:

<pre>
xv6 kernel is booting
$ nsh
@ grep Ken < README
xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
@ 
</pre>

<p>
Please do <b>not</b> use a memory allocator such as <tt>malloc()</tt>.
Instead you should use only local (stack-allocated) variables and
global variables. It's OK to impose reasonable fixed limits on things
like the maximum length of a command name, the maximum number of
arguments, or the maximum length of any single argument.

<p>
We supply you with an xv6 test program <tt>testsh</tt>,
source in <tt>user/testsh.c</tt>.
You're
done with the lab if your shell passes all the tests, like this:

<pre>
$ testsh nsh
simple echo: PASS
simple grep: PASS
two commands: PASS
output redirection: PASS
input redirection: PASS
both redirections: PASS
simple pipe: PASS
pipe and redirects: PASS
lots of commands: PASS
passed all tests
</pre>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>In this and future labs you will progressively build up your xv6,
  but it will be handy to maintain a branch per lab:
  <pre>
  $ <kbd>git fetch</kbd>
  $ <kbd>git checkout sh</kbd>
  </pre>

<p>You don't have to merge an earlier lab solution into subsequent
  labs.  If you find you need some work from earlier lab, you are free
  to merge it into later branches, but most labs are fairly
  independent of each other.

<p>
Git allows switching between existing branches using <kbd>git
checkout <i>branch-name</i></kbd>, though you should commit any
outstanding changes on one branch before switching to a different
one.

<h3>Hints</h3>

<p>
You don't need to implement features that aren't required by the
tests; for example, you don't have to implement parentheses or
quoting.

<p>
The Kernighan and Ritchie C book is full of useful bits of code; feel
free to incorporate any of it in your solution (with comments
stating where you got the code). For
example, you may find useful the <tt>gettoken()</tt> function from the
parser in Section 5.12.

<p>
nsh is much simpler than xv6's sh in terms of features, so you are
likely best off writing nsh from scratch.  But, you can look at the xv6
shell source (in <tt>user/sh.c</tt>) for ideas, and borrow code, as
long as you include comments saying where you got the code.

<p>
Xv6 supplies you with a small library of C functions in <tt>user/ulib.c</tt>;
feel free to use them. As mentioned above,
however, you are not allowed to use <tt>malloc()</tt>.

<p>
Remember to close un-needed file descriptors, both to avoid
running out, and because a process reading a pipe won't see
end-of-file until all the write descriptors for that pipe are closed.

<p>
Every system call in your code should check whether the call returned an error.

<p>
<tt>testsh</tt> redirects your shell's standard output, which means
you won't see it. Your shell
should print error and debug messages to file descriptor 2, the standard error,
using <tt>fprintf(2,...)</tt>.

<p>
If <tt>testsh</tt> complains, it may help to modify
<tt>testsh</tt> to print the command it wants your shell to run,
and to modify your shell to print the command-line(s) it receives
and the commands it executes.

<p>
Another helpful trick is to modify <tt>one()</tt> in <tt>testsh.c</tt>
to print the output it read from your shell, and the output it expected.
