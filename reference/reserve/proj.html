<p>If you are taking 6.828, you must do a project in a team of two to
pass 6.828.  Some ideas for projects are below.  The deadlines for
the project are as follows:
<ul>
<li> Email idea to staff: Due, September 19, 2019 <br>
<li> Email proposal to staff: Due, October 3, 2019 <br>
<li> Email project status update: Due, October 31, 2019 <br>
<li> Email project status update: Due, November 14, 2019 <br>
<li> Code repository and short report Due, December 6, 2019 <br>
<li> Check-off and in-class demos, Week of December 9, 2019<br>
</ul>

<h2>Project ideas</h2>

<ul>

<li> Build a virtual machine monitor that can run multiple guests (for
example, multiple instances of xv6), using trap-and-emulate.

<li> Make the xv6 file system implement high-performance logging in
  the spirit of of Linux EXT3.

<li> Use file system ideas
from <a href="https://ng.gnunet.org/sites/default/files/10.1.1.40.3691.pdf">WAFL</a>,
ZFS, or another advanced file system.  For example, add file system as
it appeared at various points in the past.  You'll probably want to
use some kind of copy-on-write for disk storage to keep space
consumption down.

<li> Build a
<a href="http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~csc469h/fall/handouts/nitzberg91.pdf">distributed shared memory</a> (DSM) system, so that you can run
multi-threaded shared memory parallel programs on a cluster of
machines, using paging to give the appearance of real shared memory.
When a thread tries to access a page that's on another machine, the
page fault will give the DSM system a chance to fetch the page over
the network from whatever machine currently stores it.

<li> Allow processes to migrate from one machine to another over the
network. You'll need to do something about the various pieces of a process's
state in the kernel.

<li>Implement containers for xv6.

<li>Use <a
 href="http://static.usenix.org/event/osdi06/tech/erlingsson.html">xfi</a> to
sandbox code within a process.

<li>Modify xv6 to have kernel-supported threads inside processes.
  Implementing scheduler activations would be one way to do this
  project.

<li>Implement ideas from
  the <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/readings/engler95exokernel.pdf">Exokernel
  papers</a> in xv6, for example the packet filter and a user-level
  network stack.

<li>A window system for xv6, including graphics driver and mouse.

<li>Make xv6 runs on real RISC-V hardware and do something cool with it.

<li>Implement dynamic linking on xv6 and use it in interesting ways.

<li>Implement TCP/IP for xv6.

<li>Implement address space randomization for xv6.

<li>Implement side-channel mitigation techniques in xv6.

<li>Do something substantive in Linux.  For example, implement
  sv6's refcache and radixvm in Linux.

<li>Port Biscuit work to RISC-V.

<li>Rewrite xv6 (or parts of it) in Rust.

<li>Kernel pcqrofiler for xv6

</ul>
